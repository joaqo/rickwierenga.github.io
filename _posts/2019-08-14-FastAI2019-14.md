For the final lesson of fast.ai I redid the first project of the course. In Swift. (Read the [first post](https://rickwierenga.com/blog/fast.ai/FastAI2019-1.html) so you know what we're building) After using Swift and TensorFlow for the first time yesterday ([post](http://rickwierenga.com/blog/fast.ai/FastAI2019-13.html)), I want to use Swift for everything. So I figured it might be fun to do a project I am familiar with and see what the similarities and differences are.

This the last post about my fast.ai journey. Read all the posts [here](https://rickwierenga.com/tag/fastai).

> If you have never used s4tf, check out [yesterday's post](http://rickwierenga.com/blog/fast.ai/FastAI2019-13.html) for a quick introduction.

```swift
import Foundation
import Python

let fastai = Python.import("fastai")
let vision = Python.import("fastai.vision")
let pathlib = Python.import("pathlib")
let np = Python.import("numpy")
let plt = Python.import("matplotlib.pylab")
```

## Loading the data: SwiftKaggle

Because there is no Swifty API to interact with the  Kaggle API in Swift yet, I am going to write my own. Check out the [GitHub project](https://github.com/rickwierenga/SwiftKaggle).

Because the GitHub project is not yet a full Swift package that can be used in Jupyter Notebooks with a Swift kernel, copy the contents of `Kaggle.swift` for now.

Authenticating and downloading a dataset from  Kaggle is easy using the SwiftKaggle API:

```swift
let kaggle = Kaggle(username: "kajs21rjk", key: "110c53139229dd1fc1394d5052c44757")
kaggle.download(dataset: "fruits", byUser: "moltean")
```

Because SwiftKaggle is far from finished, you need to unwrap the files manually for now. Note that the `isDir` value is passed as a pointer because `FileManager` is an Objective-C class.

```swift
var isDir: ObjCBool = true
if !(FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath: "fruits-360", isDirectory: &isDir)) {
  os.system("unzip fruits.zip > /dev/null")
}
```

Remember from the first post, this is what the data looks like:

## Using `FastAi` in Swift

As you saw in the introduction, the `fastai.vision` module should be imported separately.

 Everything else is quite similar to the Python version of this project I made in lesson 1.

Define the path of the data:

```swift
let path = pathlib.Path("fruits-360")
```

A better version of Python's Pathlib library is available in swift ([Path.swift](https://github.com/mxcl/Path.swift)). However, this API can't be used with the Swift wrapper of fastai yet.

Creating a databunch is quite similar to Python as well:

```swift
np.random.seed(2)
let data = vision.ImageDataBunch.from_folder(path, train: ".", valid_pct: 0.2,
        ds_tfms: vision.get_transforms(), size: 224, num_workers: 4).normalize(vision.imagenet_stats)
```

Showing the data as I did in the first post is not working in Swift at this point. Swift does not seem to be able to output HTML code to Jupyter notebooks yet. I hope it will be in the future. Here's the code for people from the future:

```swift
data.show_batch(rows: 3, figsize: PythonObject(tupleOf: 7, 8))
```

Training the model is, surprisingly, virtually identical to Python:

```swift
let learn = vision.cnn_learner(data, vision.models.resnet34, metrics: vision.error_rate)
learn.fit_one_cycle(4)
```

We have to use `vision.` to use library methods. This is a neat way of keeping code clear, though it can be a little annoying to type.

Unfortunately, because Swift doesn't support HTML objects in Jupyter Notebooks yet, the output of the training code is ambiguous.

## Conclusion

This project concludes my fast.ai journey. It has been incredible and I am super excited to learn more. I will probably write a full review on fast.ai, stay tuned for that. Follow [me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rickwierenga) to get notified when I release the post.

I can't wait to start working on the full version of `SwiftKaggle` in two weeks. Make sure to follow the project [on GitHub](https://github.com/rickwierenga/swiftkaggle) to stay up to date with the development.
